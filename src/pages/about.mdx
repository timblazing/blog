# About

Nordlys is a minimal Astro blog theme, ideal for a personal blog and showcasing a projects portfolio. It is fully customizable with baked-in theming and ready-to-use components. Developed by [FjellOverflow](https://github.com/FjellOverflow) using [Astro](https://astro.build/) and [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/). The name _Nordlys_ comes from Norwegian and means [_Northern Lights_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aurora) or [_Aurora_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aurora), which is also reflected in the logo!

## Built-in Pages
