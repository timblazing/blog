Nordlys not only features a dark and light mode, but also predefined color schemes that are ready to use, as well as the option to add custom schemes.

## Using a Predefined Scheme

Simply set `colorScheme` in the theme configuration (`theme.config.ts`) to one of the predefined schemes.

### Mono

The `scheme-mono` color scheme features a simple yet elegant white accent on black background.


### Nord

The `scheme-nord` color scheme is inspired by [Nord](https://www.nordtheme.com/), an arctic, north-bluish color palette.


### Aurora

The `scheme-aurora` color scheme resembles glowingly green northern lights against a dark grey night sky.


## Adding a New Scheme

I addition to the predefined color schemes, it's very simple to add a custom scheme. Just choose a primary (accent) color and a background color, and add them to `color-schemes.css`. Make sure to use the RGB values of the colors in the same format as shown.

```css src/style/color-schemes.css
@layer base {
  .scheme-custom {
    --accent: 0, 0, 0;
    --accent-bg: 255, 255, 255;

    &[data-mode='dark'] {
      --accent: 255, 255, 255;
      --accent-bg: 0, 0, 0;
    }
  }
```
If you want use the newly defined scheme, set it in the `theme.config.ts`.

```ts src/theme.config.ts
  export default defineThemeConfig({
    colorScheme: 'scheme-custom'

    // ...
```

Most likely, your IDE or editor will display a TypeError indicating that the scheme is not a valid choice. While this is not a critical error, you can fix it by adding `scheme-custom` as a valid option to the `ColorSchemes` array in the type definition.

```ts src/types.ts
export const ColorSchemes = [
  // other schemes
  'scheme-custom'
] as const
```

And that's it!
